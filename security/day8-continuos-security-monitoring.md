# Day 8: Continuous Security Monitoring with AWS

In today's world of rapid digital transformation, it is crucial to ensure your cloud infrastructure security. Amazon Web Services (AWS) provides a range of instruments for keeping your security posture strong by continuous surveillance. In this blog post, we will explore in detail AWS GuardDuty, Security Hub and Amazon Inspector â€“ how you can use these services for constant threat detection, vulnerability scanning and compliance monitoring. Moreover, we shall explain why log analysis and Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) integration are important towards achieving complete security monitoring.

## AWS GuardDuty: Real-time Threat Detection

AWS GuardDuty is a threat detection and continuous monitoring service that monitors your AWS accounts and workloads for malicious activities and unauthorized behavior. The use of machine learning, anomaly detection, as well as integrated threat intelligence, enables the identification and prioritization of potential threats.

### Configuring GuardDuty

To start using GuardDuty, you need to enable it in your AWS Management Console. Here's how you can do it with AWS CLI:

```shell
aws guardduty create-detector --enable --detector-id <your-detector-id> --finding-publishing-frequency FIFTEEN_MINUTES
```
This command creates a GuardDuty detector and sets it to publish findings every fifteen minutes.

**AWS Security Hub:** Centralized Security Monitoring
AWS Security Hub gives you a comprehensive view of your security state within AWS and helps you check your environment against security industry standards and best practices.

#### Enabling Security Hub
You can enable Security Hub and import findings from other services like GuardDuty, Amazon Inspector, and more with the following CLI command:

```shell
aws securityhub enable-security-hub --enable-default-standards
```

This command not only enables Security Hub but also activates the default security standards.


## Amazon Inspector: Automated Security Assessment
Amazon Inspector automatically assesses applications for exposure, vulnerabilities, and deviations from best practices.

#### Running an Assessment Template
After defining an assessment target, use the following CLI command to run an assessment:

```shell
aws inspector start-assessment-run --assessment-template-arn <your-template-arn>
```

This command initiates an assessment run based on the specified template ARN.

## Log Analysis and SIEM Integration

Log analysis is crucial for identifying security incidents, troubleshooting issues, and ensuring compliance. AWS provides several tools for log management, such as CloudWatch Logs. Integrating your AWS environment with a SIEM solution can further enhance your security monitoring capabilities.

### Streaming Logs to SIEM

You can stream logs from AWS to your SIEM solution using Amazon Kinesis Firehose. Here's a basic example to create a delivery stream:

```shell
aws firehose create-delivery-stream --delivery-stream-name <your-stream-name> --s3-destination-configuration RoleARN=<your-role-arn>,BucketARN=<your-bucket-arn>
```

This command sets up a Kinesis Firehose delivery stream to forward logs to an S3 bucket, which can then be ingested by your SIEM.

### Conclusion

Cloud security demands continual security monitoring as an essential part of it. With AWS services like GuardDuty, Security Hub, and Amazon Inspector designed to help you improve at detecting threats and vulnerabilities, as well as ensuring compliance. Additionally, integrating log analysis with SIEM solutions allows you to see the big picture in terms of your security posture, greatly contributing to proactive detection, investigation, and response to possible security risks.

By learning and adopting the proper tools and processes, you will be able to establish a strong and robust cloud architecture capable of withstanding any malicious attack on your data or applications.
